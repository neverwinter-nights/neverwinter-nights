This place bears the name of _Neverwinter Nights_ in memory of one of the greatest computer games of the human kind. 

If you do not know, `Neverwinter Nights` game was released in the year 2002 by the _Atari_ corporation. Developers of this game were such companies as _BioWare_ and _Obsidian Entertainment_. The original `Neverwinter Nights` game has set such a high quality level in the game development industry, that no one of modern game developers has been able to reach that level in the 20 years since that day. The possibilities to create in the `Neverwinter Nights` are still unbeaten even by the most well known, successful, expensive and profitable game franchises of this world. Unfortunately, no one has tried to give the players similar powers to create game worlds ever since. Even those who tried to "enhance" the game, simply ripped off the support for Environmental Audio Extensions (EAX) which involved hundreds and thousands hours of labour done by the `Creative Technology` and game developers, and introduced additional bugs and new problems. It looks like, modern human beings are becoming more dumb, more egoistic and drown in their lust for gold.
